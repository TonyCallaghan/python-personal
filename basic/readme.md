# Basic Python Notes

Notes created from Udemy python course. 

## Numbers, Operators, and Comments
`+` `-` `/` `*` `%`

☝ all work the same as any other language.

`/` will always return float

> 56 / 8 returns 7.0

##### New ones to note..
`**` To the power

> 3**3 returns 27 (int)

`//` divide without remainder

> 56.2 / 8 = 7.0

☝ Rounds down to nearest whole number

## Comments
`#` Single Line Comment

No such thing as a multi line comment in Python.
