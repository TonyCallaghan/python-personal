# Basic Python Notes

Notes created from Udemy python course. 

## Numbers, Operators, and Comments
`+` `-` `/` `*` `%`

☝ all work the same as any other language.

`/` will always return float

> 56 / 8 returns 7.0

<br>

### New ones to note..
`**` To the power

> 3**3 returns 27 (int)

`//` divide without remainder

> 56.2 / 8 = 7.0

☝ Rounds down to nearest whole number

<br>

### Comments
`#` Single Line Comment

No such thing as a multi line comment in Python.

## Naming Conventions
- Most variables should be **snake_case** (underscores between words)

`my_answer = 43`

- Most variablkes should be lowercase with some exceptions:
  1. **CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE** usually refers to constants `VALUE_OF_PI = 3.14`
  2. **UpperCamelCase usually refers to a class.

- Variables that start/end with 2 underscores, supposed to be private/left alone
`__Dont_touch__`
